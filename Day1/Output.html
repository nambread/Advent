        --- Day 1: Not Quite Lisp ---<br /><br />        Santa was hoping for a white Christmas, but his weather machine's &quot;snow&quot; function is powered by stars, and he's fresh out! To save Christmas, he needs you to collect fifty stars by December 25th.<br /><br />        Collect stars by helping Santa solve puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!<br /><br />        Here's an easy puzzle to warm you up.<br /><br />        Santa is trying to deliver presents in a large apartment building, but he can't find the right floor - the directions he got are a little confusing. He starts on the ground floor (floor 0) and then follows the instructions one character at a time.<br /><br />        An opening parenthesis, (, means he should go up one floor, and a closing parenthesis, ), means he should go down one floor.<br /><br />        The apartment building is very tall, and the basement is very deep; he will never find the top or bottom floors.<br /><br />        For example:<br /><br />        (()) and ()() both result in floor 0.<br />        ((( and (()(()( both result in floor 3.<br />        ))((((( also results in floor 3.<br />        ()) and ))( both result in floor -1 (the first basement level).<br />        ))) and )())()) both result in floor -3.<br />        To what floor do the instructions take Santa?<br /><br />        --- Part Two ---<br /><br />        Now, given the same instructions, find the position of the first character that causes him to enter the basement (floor -1). The first character in the instructions has position 1, the second character has position 2, and so on.<br /><br />        For example:<br /><br />        ) causes him to enter the basement at character position 1.<br />        ()()) causes him to enter the basement at character position 5.<br />        What is the position of the character that causes Santa to first enter the basement?
